This [app](https://discover-tmdb.netlify.app/) makes use of the [themoviedb](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) API to implement media categorization, filteration and search using React and Redux.

# Installing
Perform `yarn install` in the root directory.

# Running
Perform `yarn start` in the root directory.

# Note
The API key is stored in the environment variable via `dotenv` and so the file is not committed to the repo. Make a `.env` once cloned in the root directory and add a `REACT_APP_API_KEY=<value>` to it where `<value>` is your API key.
